# vdem-codes

This repo contains the master file information for V-Dem country codes. The country-code pairs are stored in the corresponding CSV file. An R function is also provided to assign these codes.

## To Do
* Organize CSV by code
    + Check for duplicates
    + Make it easier to add codes sequentially
* Create a corresponding Stata .do file
* Create a script that can by run by (essentially) anybody to update the Stata file on demand whenever the CSV file is updated
